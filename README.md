# Library Project
https://fadingmorsecode.github.io/library/
# Project Summary:
This project's main purpose is to demonstrate the ability to implement an object constructor and then use it to create book items with details that can be filled out by the user. It uses toggles to allow the user to say whether they have read the book or not. This project is not meant to be responsive but I hope to give it a revist in the future after getting to that point in the curriculum.
# Goals:
* Create a small library app
* Use constructors and new objects 
* Allow creation and removal of book cards
* Have the ability to add a read status which is stored on the object
# In Action:

# Reflection:
This was a very exciting project. Like most projects that I have done up until this point, it provided me with a greater understanding of the previous concepts that were taught in the TOP curriculum and I was able to successfully complete the required tasks. I tried to use the DRY principle whenever I could. I'm usually pretty critical of myself so I'm not always satisfied with how my code turns out, but I feel as though I (hopefully) kept it somewhat tame. The instances where I had breakthroughs felt like pure bliss. Thinking of how I would get my read status to work took me a while, but I did some research on the TOP discord and was able to figure it out. There were of course some things I've never done before in coding so it made me extremely happy when they were coming together. In conclusion, I had a great time doing the library project and I'm looking forward to the next!
